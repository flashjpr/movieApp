# TDD Approach to building Angular 1 Applications

### Taking a simple example of fetching movies from the [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and displaying them in an application using the Test-Driven-Development approach

Is the result and exercise of followint the Pluralsight course [**AngularJS Unit Testing in-depth, Using ngMock**](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angularjs-ngmock-unit-testing).

It taught me how to Unit Test Angular 1 applications using ng-mock, including but not limited to :

* ngMockâ€™s Core Functions
* HTTP Interactions with ngMock
* Controllers with ngMock
* with Timeouts and Intervals
* Directives with $rootScope
* Dates
* Exceptions
* Logging
* Testing with ngMockE2E BackEnd
